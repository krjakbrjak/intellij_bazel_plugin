# Bazel plugin for Intellij IDEA


Intellij IDEA is an incredible tool for creative and efficient coding.
it supports a huge list of external tools that make this IDE even more
fun to work with.

At some point, I was curious about how easy it would be to integrate another
external tool. At the same time, I happened to start working with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)
build system that is not officially supported by IDEA. Thus, I have decided to
try to integrate it and get familiar with the internals of the tool I like.

Currently, it supports "import from existing sources" action.
